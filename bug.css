The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results when used with percentages and different units.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not behave as expected if the parent element's width is dynamically sized or relies on other percentage-based widths. The calculation is done based on the context of the element and can be thrown off by unexpected sizing behaviors elsewhere.
